This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Loading Necessary Libraries
library(dplyr)
library(DOSE)

#Copying over the dataframe
geneList <- SIRT5cor_all
#geneList <- geneList[order(-geneList$SIRT5),]


#Creating the correct data struture for input, a named vector of correlation values for analysis. Ensured to be sorted in 
#decreasing order
genes = geneList[["SIRT5"]]
names(genes) = (geneList[["ENTREZID"]])
genes = sort(genes , decreasing = TRUE)

#GeneSetEncrichmentAnalysis using the DOSE library 
edo2 <- gseNCG(geneList = genes, verbose = TRUE)

#Loading visualization libraries
library(enrichplot)

#Creating a dotplot for Visualization 
p2 <- dotplot(edo2, showCategory=30) + ggtitle("dotplot for GSEA")
plot_grid(p2, ncol=1)

#Creating a network map with the category as central nodes
edox <- setReadable(edo2, 'org.Hs.eg.db', 'ENTREZID')
cnetplot(edox, colorEdge = TRUE)

#cnetplot(edox,circular = TRUE, colorEdge = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
